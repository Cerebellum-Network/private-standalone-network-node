# Asset Restrictions
Support for the locking of assets by time or by issuer permission, support for expirations and potentially invalidations.

### Initially Supported features
* Distribution management
* Derivative assets expiration
* invalidation post-issurance (not in current scope)

#### Distribution management
By default, the transfer of assets are limited to between an User account and an Application account only and vice versa, this is to limit secondary market for assets beyond an enterprise's control. More distribution wallets can be added to an application to facilitate such transfers, so that distribution wallets that can be used by the application are manageable by the asset issuer.

#### Derivative assets expiration
A possibility to allow the issuing of assets that represent in-app rewards and discount vouchers with time limitations (e.g. expiration date on a coupon). Expiration is associated with the asset at the time of issuance.

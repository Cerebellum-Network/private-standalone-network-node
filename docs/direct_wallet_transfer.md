# Direct Wallet Transfer
Support for the most Substrate/Polkadot based wallet applications. Smart Contract transfer function allows for the directly wallet-signed transfer of assets from application's address (distribution account) to the user's address and vice versa. There is also a possibility to add more wallets (distribution accounts) to the "White List".

### Steps to make a transfer

# Turn-key Private Blockchain Network

This is a turn-key Private/Permissioned/Standalone blockchain network which can be readily integrated by any enterprise. Since itâ€™s built with Substrate, this network can be integrated into any Polkadot/Substrate based Layer 1 network to serve as a secondary chain.

This turn-key network intends to abstract the implementation complexity for businesses, as well as providing a ready-made package to optimize for a higher level of security, privacy, and performance, and to serve as a template or base-implementation of a highly customizable and performant enterprise specific blockchain network.
